# Employee Attrition Analysis

## Summary
This Jupyter Notebook uses machine learning addresses to analyze employee attrition. Getting data, creating models, collecting them, and training them are all covered. An external CSV file was utilized as the source of the dataset used in this research.

## Contents
The notebook is structured as follows:

1. **Preprocessing**
   - Load the dataset
   - Perform data cleaning and transformation
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Split data into training and testing sets
   - Standardize numerical features

2. **Model Development**
   - Build a neural network model using TensorFlow/Keras
   - Compile the model with appropriate loss functions and optimizers
   - Train the model using the processed dataset

3. **Evaluation and Summary**
   - Assess model performance
   - Analyze key metrics such as accuracy and loss
   - Discuss potential improvements to the model

## Dependencies
To run this notebook, you need the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow`
